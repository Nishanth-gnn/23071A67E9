I observed three different images of a shark, each created by different tools. 
The first image, generated by ChatGPT, presented a realistic depiction of a shark in its natural habitat, swimming gracefully through the water.
The second image, generated by Deep Seek, showcased a more stylized version, with exaggerated features and a vibrant color palette that gave it a surreal look.
Lastly, DALLÂ·E produced an artistic rendering of a shark, with smooth lines and minimalistic details, making it look both sleek and abstract.
Each image provided a unique perspective, capturing the essence of a shark in different artistic styles.
